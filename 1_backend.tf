Always create your s3 bucket and dynamodb_table for backend.tf manually from console, 
because these are hightly sensitive files and you do not want that managed by terrform.
IF terraform manages them, it can easilty be accidentally deleted, which will be disastrous. 

Always use partition key as lock ID for dynamoDn
